The goal of this app is to become a quick starter app based on good architecture principles
and the latest technologies and libraries that a big percentage of apps use.

Current implementation:
Room
Retrofit

architecture mvvm: not fully implemented!

api:
is a fake api just for testing purposes

the app consists of a login page
connecting to the fake api,
a view pager with 3 screens
home screen has  a recycler view 
that lists some data from the fake api.

Next steps
* full mvvm implementation
* add notifications 
* settings page.
* splash screen
* add graphs based on fake data
* possible Koin implementation for dependency injection
